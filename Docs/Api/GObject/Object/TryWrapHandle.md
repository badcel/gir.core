# Object.TryWrapHandle&lt;T&gt; method

A variant of [`WrapHandle`](WrapHandle.md) which fails gracefully if the pointer cannot be wrapped.

```csharp
public static bool TryWrapHandle<T>(IntPtr handle, bool ownedRef, out T o)
    where T : Object
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T |  |
| handle | A pointer to the native GObject that should be wrapped. |
| o | A C# proxy object which wraps the native GObject. |
| ownedRef | Specify if the ref is owned by us, because ownership was transferred. |

## Return Value

`true` if the handle was wrapped, or `false` if something went wrong.
