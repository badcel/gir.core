# Object.WrapHandle&lt;T&gt; method

This function returns the proxy object to the provided handle if it already exists, otherwise creates a new wrapper object and returns it. Note that *T* is the type the object should be returned. It is independent of the object's actual type and is provided purely for convenience.

```csharp
public static T WrapHandle<T>(IntPtr handle, bool ownedRef)
    where T : Object
```
